Abstract
Cholecystokinin-expressing GABAergic (CCK-GABA) neurons are perisomatic inhibitory cells that have been
arguedtoregulateemotionandsculptthenetworkoscillationsassociatedwithcognition.However,nostudyhas
selectively manipulated CCK-GABA neuron activity during behavior in freely-moving animals. To explore the
behavioral effects of activating CCK-GABA neurons on emotion and cognition, we utilized a novel intersectional
genetic mouse model coupled with a chemogenetic approach. Specifically, we generated triple transgenic
CCK-Cre;Dlx5/6-Flpe;RC::FL-hM3Dq (CCK-GABA/hM3Dq) mice that expressed the synthetic excitatory hM3Dq
receptor in CCK-GABA neurons. Results showed that clozapine-N-oxide (CNO)-mediated activation of CCK-
GABAneuronsdidnotalteropenfield(OF)ortailsuspension(TS)performanceandonlyslightlyincreasedanxiety
in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Although CNO treatment had only modestly affected emotional behavior, it
significantly enhanced multiple cognitive and memory behaviors including social recognition, contextual fear condi-
tioning, contextual discrimination, object recognition, and problem-solving in the puzzle box. Collectively, these
findingssuggestthatsystemicactivationofCCK-GABAneuronsminimallyaffectsemotionbutsignificantlyenhances

expectedandcouldserveasapotentialtherapeutictargetforthetreatmentofcognitive/memorydisorders.

Significance Statement
Cholecystokinin-expressing GABAergic (CCK-GABA) neurons are thought to play an important role in
pathologies such as schizophrenia, but their contributions to behavior in healthy states are poorly under-
stood.HerewereportanovelmethodforselectivelytargetingCCK-GABAneuronsandmanipulatingtheir
activity during behavioral tasks. Our data demonstrate that activating CCK-GABA neurons subtly affects
emotional behavior but surprisingly enhances multiple memory and cognitive processes.
