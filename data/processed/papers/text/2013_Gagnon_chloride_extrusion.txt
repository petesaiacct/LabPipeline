Abstract
The K+-Cl− cotransporter KCC2 is responsible for maintaining low Cl− concentration in neurons
of the central nervous system (CNS), essential for postsynaptic inhibition through GABA and
A
glycine receptors. While no CNS disorders have been associated with KCC2 mutations, loss of
activity of this transporter has emerged as a key mechanism underlying several neurological and
psychiatric disorders including epilepsy, motor spasticity, stress, anxiety, schizophrenia, morphine-
induced hyperalgesia and chronic pain1–9. Recent reports indicate that enhancing KCC2 activity
may be the favoured therapeutic strategy to restore inhibition and normal function in pathological
condition involving impaired Cl− transport10–12. We designed an assay for high-throughput
screening which led to the identification of KCC2 activators that reduce [Cl−]. Optimization of a
i
first-in-class arylmethylidine family of compounds resulted in a KCC2-selective analog (CLP257)
that lowers [Cl−]. CLP257 restored impaired Cl− transport in neurons with diminished KCC2

activity. The compound rescued KCC2 plasma membrane expression, renormalised stimulus-
evoked responses in spinal nociceptive pathways sensitized after nerve injury and alleviated
hypersensitivity in a rat model of neuropathic pain. Oral efficacy for analgesia equivalent to that of

To identify compounds that increase Cl− efflux, a simple fluorometric assay was developed
to measure [Cl−] in real-time. As a model, we chose the NG-108 cell line which expresses
i
low levels of KCC2 protein (Fig. 1a), and in which the Cl−-sensitive indicator clomeleon13
was stably transfected. The low KCC2 activity of NG-108 cells mimics the
pathophysiological situation in neuropathic pain. The fluorometric assay was calibrated and
validated by placing NG108-cl and KCC2-lacking HEK293-cl cells14–16 in isosmolar
extracellular media containing increasing [Cl−] in permeabilized cells to clamp [Cl−] at
i
different levels. We found a linear relationship between the fluorescence ratio and [Cl−] in
i
both cell lines and determined a resting [Cl−] of 57.15 ± 2.43 mM (SD) for NG108-cl and
i
56.15 ± 2.73 mM (SD) for HEK293-cl (Fig. 1b). In non-permeabilized NG108-cl cells [Cl−]
i
did not change with increasing [Cl−] , indicating little endogenous Cl− transport in these
e
cells (Fig. 1a). In contrast, [Cl−] varied slightly in HEK293-cl when [Cl−] was elevated,
i e
consistent with their higher NKCC1 expression (Fig. 1a). The fluorescence ratio within the
range of [Cl−] tested was minimally affected by pH (Fig. 1b). High-throughput screening of
i
a 92,500 drug-like17 compound library was then carried out to identify small molecules able
to reduce [Cl−]. A total of 78 were confirmed as positive hits. Many of these compounds i
could be grouped into chemical families sharing similar structure. Hits were further selected
for lack of effects on [Cl−] in HEK293-cl cells, which do not express KCC2 but do express
i
NKCC1, KCC1, KCC3 and KCC416,18 (Fig. 1a). Further selection based on lack of
cytotoxic effects, ease of synthesis and drug-like properties17 identified the hit compound
CL-058 for further characterization and optimization (Fig. 1c,d).
More than 300 unique analogues of CL-058 were synthesized to improve potency and drug-
like properties17. This lead optimization campaign defined a clear structure-activity
relationship (Supplementary Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 1), and improved on the potency
of CL-058 (EC = 31.5 μM) by almost 3 logs with compounds such as CLP355 (EC = 50
50 50
nM; Fig. 1d). CLP257 (EC = 616 nM) was chosen for further characterization due to its
50
better chemical stability and overall properties. Maximal [Cl−] reduction by CLP257 was
i
~40%, a 23mM drop from resting [Cl−] of 57 mM.
i
We found no change in [Cl−] in HEK293-cl cells when incubated with CLP257 (Fig. 1e), i
indicating inactivity on NKCC1, KCC1, KCC3 or KCC4. Additionally, a Rb+-flux assay of
CLP257 selectivity was performed in Xenopus laevis oocytes microinjected with cRNA
coding for the various transporters of the cation chloride cotransporter (CCC) family (Fig.
1f). Oocyte pre-incubation with CLP257 (200 nM) increased KCC2 transport activity by
61% (P < 0.01), but caused no change in other CCCs (Fig. 1f). Functional, dose-dependent
antagonism was also observed between CLP257 and the recently characterized KCC2
antagonist VU024055119 (Fig. 1g). The affinity of CLP257 for classical pharmacological

targets was also assessed using radioligand competition binding assays. Of the 55
radioligand-receptor interactions tested, none were inhibited by more than 30% at 10 μM of
CLP257 (Supplementary Table 2). Importantly, CLP257 (50 μM) provoked < 0.2% of the
effect of 5 μM muscimol in CHO cells transduced with recombinant α1β2γ2 GABA
A
receptors, indicating negligible agonist activity of CLP257 on GABA . receptors. Taken
A
together these data show that CLP257 reduces [Cl−] through selective modulation of KCC2.

We then tested whether CLP257 could reverse KCC2 hypofunction in mature neurons. The
effect of CLP257 on Cl− transport was measured in spinal slices obtained from animals with
peripheral nerve injury (PNI; as an experimental model of neuropathic pain)20 and control
slices pre-treated with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which mediates
downregulation of KCC2 activity21,22 in models of pain hypersensitivity3,9,23–27. The
function of KCC2 was assessed by quantitatively measuring K+-driven Cl− influx via
fluorescent lifetime measurements of the Cl− probe MQAE10 (Fig. 2a,b,c). Using abrupt
elevation of [K+] to trigger KCC2-dependent Cl− influx, we found that CLP257 (25 μM)
e
significantly increased the rate of Cl− accumulation in both BDNF-treated and PNI spinal
slices by 26% and 45%, respectively (Fig. 2d,e; P < 0.05). At 100 μM, CLP257 completely
restored Cl− transport to control levels in BDNF-treated slices. Thus, CLP257effectively
enhanced Cl− transport in CNS neurons with reduced KCC2 function.
We tested whether CLP257 modulates Cl− extrusion capacity using voltage-clamp
recordings from superficial dorsal horn (SDH) neurons in spinal cord slices treated with
BDNF and isolated from rats with PNI3. A Cl− load was imposed through the recording
pipette to measure Cl− extrusion capacity via the reversal potential for GABA currents
A
(E )9. E was depolarized in SDH neurons of BDNF-treated and PNI slices (Fig.
GABA GABA
2f,g,h). In both conditions, E was hyperpolarized by 25 μM CLP257 (Fig. 2h),
GABA
reflecting an increase in neuronal Cl− extrusion capacity. Thus, CLP257 can restore Cl−
extrusion capacity in neurons with reduced KCC2 activity23. The effects of CLP257 on
E were independent of changes in GABA conductance, since acute application of
GABA A
CLP257 had no effect on evoked GABA currents in the presence of the KCC2 antagonist
A
VU0240551 (P > 0.05; Fig. 2i).
To identify the mechanism by which CLP257 restored KCC2 activity, we immunoblotted
KCC2 protein in BDNF-pretreated slices. We found that, while total KCC2 expression was
not significantly affected (P > 0.05), the cell surface expression of both KCC2 monomers
and dimers was increased in CLP257-treated slices (Fig. 3a,b; P < 0.05). This indicates that
CLP257 modulates plasmalemmal KCC2 protein turnover post-translationally.
The antinociceptive efficacy of CLP257 was tested in PNI rats3,20,28,29 (Fig. 4a–d). We
measured evoked field electrophysiological responses in the superficial dorsal horn to graded
mechanical stimuli of the hind foot. In naïve animals, CLP257 had no effect on the stimulus-
response relationship over the entire range of stimulus intensity (2.5 to 135 g (mm2)−1; Fig.
4a,c,d). Evoked field responses were increased in animals with nerve injury (Fig. 4d; P <
0.05), but were renormalized by CLP257 (Fig 4b,c,d.).

CLP257 also normalized mechanical withdrawal thresholds in PNI animals. Intraperitoneal
(IP) administration of CLP257 increased withdrawal thresholds, peaking at 100 mg kg−1, 2 h
post-injection (Fig. 4e). Yet, the maximal analgesic effect of CLP257 was much weaker than
that of Gabapentin (Fig. 4e). We hypothesized that a poor pharmacokinetic profile could
limit CLP257 efficacy. Indeed, pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that plasma concentration
of CLP257 declines rapidly, with a terminal half-life (t ) of < 15 min (Fig. 4f). Metabolite
1/2
analyses revealed that the hydroxyl moiety of CLP257 rapidly undergoes glucuronidation
(not shown) to produce an inactive metabolite (see CLP386, Supplementary Table 1)
To improve the pharmacokinetics of CLP257, a carbamate prodrug (CLP290) was designed
to protect the hydroxyl group from glucuronidation. The pharmacokinetic profile of CLP257
produced from the metabolism of CLP290 was much improved over that of native CLP257,
with an apparent t of 5 h and improved maximal plasma concentration and exposure (Fig.
1/2
4f). The analgesic efficacy of CLP290 was also improved, with maximal oral efficacy
equivalent to that of Pregabalin albeit at a higher dose (100 mg kg−1 vs 30 mg kg−1; Fig. 4g).
Pregabalin can cause sedation and dizziness, greatly affecting motor performance30. For
comparison, the motor impact of equipotent oral doses of CLP290 and Pregabalin was
evaluated using an accelerating rotorod. While Pregabalin depressed motor function,
CLP290 had no effect (Fig. 4h). These results show that modulating [Cl−] produces
i
analgesia without motor side effects often seen with other analgesics.
To assess toxicity of CLP290, a 7-day repeat-dose study in rats was performed, with a
maximum daily dose of 2000 mg kg−1. We observed no effect of CLP290 on clinical
condition, body weight, food consumption, hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry,
urinalysis, organ weight, pathology and histopathology (Supplementary Table 3). The
inhibition of hERG tail current, a common risk factor for cardiotoxicity, by CLP257 and
CLP290 was weak and therefore of low risk (IC 449 μM and 224 μM, respectively).
50
Caspase-3 activation, a key process in apoptosis, was also not detected in rat hepatoma
H4IIE cells in vitro after 24-h exposure to CLP257 at up to 300 μM.
This work validates KCC2 as a druggable target and Cl− modulation as a novel mechanism
of action for the development of therapeutics31. The expression of KCC2 is limited to the
central nervous system, unlike other CCCs that are expressed in several tissues3,12,32,33,34
such as the kidneys and blood vessels where ionic homeostasis is important. This
constrained expression makes KCC2 a prime target for the control of neuronal [Cl−] and
i
should limit adverse side-effects in other organs (e.g., not expressed in choroid plexus, inner
ear or sensory fibers3,12,32,33). In fact, unlike other KCCs (KCC1, KCC3 and/or KCC4),
KCC2 is not involved in volume regulation and typically not found in cells where these
KCCs are expressed12.
The identification of a mechanism underlying neuropathic pain has allowed the development
of this new class of compounds directly aimed at hypersensitivity. Drug development was
previously limited by the poor understanding of the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain35
as reflected by the classes of currently approved drugs such as anticonvulsants36,
antidepressants37 and opioid narcotics38. As evidence is mounting that KCC2 dysfunction

and Cl− homeostasis are central to many CNS disorders1–8, we believe that Cl− extrusion
enhancers such as CLP257 and CLP290 represent a novel and important new method of
treatment for a wide range of neurological and psychiatric indications.
Materials and Methods
All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with guidelines from the
Canadian Council on Animal Care.
Cell culture, transfection, and lysis
Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) and neuroblastoma/glioma-derivative NG108-15
(NG108) cells were grown on non-coated 10 cm plates, and maintained in DMEM/High
Glucose medium (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 U
ml−1 penicillin/streptomycin mixtures (Invitrogen), with the addition of 100 μM
hypoxanthine, 0.4 μM aminopterin, 16 μM thymidine (1x HAT) to NG108 cells. Cell lines
were stably transfected with pcDNA3.1-Clomeleon using Escort IV reagent (Sigma) and
kept under selection with G418 (Sigma, 200 μg ml −1 for HEK293-cl and 400 μg ml −1 for
NG108-cl). Cells were propagated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5%
CO . Rat hippocampal cultures were prepared as described previously39. Rat hippocampi 2
were dissected out from post-natal day 0 rats and cells were dissociated, grown on poly-d-
lysine coated 3,5cm plates (1×106 cells), and maintained for 5 days in Neurobasal medium
supplemented with B27 (50:1), 50 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin mixtures, and 0.5 mM L-
glutamax, and for 5 additional days with 5 μM of cytosine arabinofuranoside (ARA-C;
Sigma)to reduce the number of glial cells. Afterwards, neurons were maintained in growth
medium and propagated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO and
2
lysed at 20 DIV. Cells were lysed at ~ 80–90% confluence in 1 ml RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-
HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS)
supplemented with Complete® protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After incubation on a
rotator (overnight; 4°C) and centrifugation at 18,000 g (15 min; 4 °C), supernatants were
transferred into new tubes and labelled total cell lysates. Total protein concentration was
determined using the Bio-Rad DC™ Protein Assay.
Immunoprecipitation studies
After incubation of ~1 mg total proteins with 5 μl of monoclonal mouse anti-KCC2 (clone
N1/12) antibodies (Neuromab) on a rotator (overnight; 4°C), KCC2 protein was purified by
addition of 50 μl RIPA-solubilised Protein A Sepharose™ CL-4B (GE Healthcare;
overnight; 4°C), and recovery of the beads by centrifugation at 9,000 g (1 min; 4°C). Finally,
immunoprecipitated KCC2 protein was released from the beads by boiling in 50μl 2x protein
sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analyses.
Cell surface biotinylation
Two rat horizontal spinal dorsal horn slices (300 μm-thick) were kept alive during 5 h in
bubbled ACSF at 34 °C. After 1h recovery, slices were treated for 2 h with 50 ng/ml BDNF,
cut longitudinally (the two same lateral sides were subjected to the same treatment) and
treated for an additional 2h with BDNF + DMSO or 100 μM CLP257. Treatment was ended

by washing slices twice in ice-cold 1X PBS. Slices were incubated (1 h; 4 °C) with 1.5
mg/ml EZ-Link® Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Thermo Scientific) in ice-cold 1X PBS buffer,
washed with ice-cold quenching solution (100 mM glycine in 1X PBS) and lysed (0,5 ml
RIPA buffer + Complete®) as described above. Biotinylated cell surface proteins were
purified from ~300 μg total lysate proteins by adding 50 μl of slurry streptavidin agarose
beads (Thermo Scientific; overnight; 4°C), and recovering the beads by centrifugation at
9,000 g (1 min; 4 °C). Finally, biotinylated cell surface proteins were released from the
beads by boiling in 40 μl of 2x protein sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and
Western blot analyses. Validation of biotinylation assay in live slices is shown by the
absence of any immunoreactive signal of the intracellular structural protein β-actin (Fig. 3a).
SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses
Total proteins (5–10 μg), cell surface biotinylated-proteins (15 μl), and immunoprecipitated-
KCC2 proteins (15 μl) were run on 8% Tris-Tricine SDS/polyacrylamide gels or on Any
kD™ TGX gels (Bio-Rad). Gels were transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane blots (Bio-
Rad) for Western blot analyses. Blots were sequentially incubated with primary and
secondary antibodies. The primary antibodies, polyclonal rabbit anti-KCC2 (Upstate),
mouse monoclonal anti-NKCC1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) and anti-β-actin
(Sigma), were used at a dilution of 1/1,000, 1/500 and 1/40,000, respectively. The secondary
antibodies, streptavidin-HRP (Cell Signalling Technology), and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP-
conjugated (Promega) and anti-mouse IgG (H+L)-HRP conjugate (Bio-Rad), were used at a
dilution of 1/2,000, 1/15,000 and 1/5,000 respectively.
Normalization of KCC2 expression
The intensity of each band on immunoblots was measured using ImageJ (NIH). Cell surface
expression of KCC2 was evaluated by the ratio cell surface expression/total expression
(surface/total). This ratio was calculated by normalizing first the KCC2 cell surface
expression to total biotinylated cell surface proteins (using streptavidin-HRP antibodies) and
the KCC2 total expression to total proteins (using anti-β-actin antibodies), and normalized a
second time, by dividing the normalized KCC2 cell surface expression by the normalized
KCC2 total expression.
Clomeleon assay
NG108-cl or HEK293-cl (~2×106) cells were grown in 96-well plates in a low Cl− assay
medium (in mM: 30 HEPES, 2 CaCl , 2 MgSO , 10 K gluconate, 2 NaH PO , adjusted to 2 4 2 4
pH 7.4 and 310 mOsm with Na gluconate). Validation of the assay was performed by adding
an equal volume of assay media at pH 7.4 and containing varying [Cl−] or varying pH and
containing 100 mM NaCl, with or without 0.15% Triton X-100. Test articles (CLP257 and
other compounds or DMSO vehicle, 4 replicates per condition) were prepared in high Cl−
assay media (in mM: 30 HEPES, 2 CaCl , 2 MgSO , 10 K gluconate, 2 NaH PO , 100
2 4 2 4
NaCl, adjusted to 310 mOsm with Na gluconate) and added to the cells in an equal volume,
resulting in a final [Cl−] of 50 mM. Low Cl− assay media containing 0.15% Triton X-100)
e
was used as positive control. [Cl−] was measured using a fluorescence microplate reader

(PerkinElmer Fusion, Ex 415 nm, Em 485 nm and 535 nm). Results are expressed as percent

with low Cl−/0.15% Triton X-100 assay media to 100% [Cl−] reduction. High-throughput
i
screening was conducted by scaling down the assay to 384-well plates and testing a 92,500
compound library (Chemdiv, Panlabs) at 10 μM in single replicates using conditions as
above. Compounds showing [Cl−] reduction greater than 3 standard deviations from
i
negative control were retested in triplicate to confirm activity.
Rb+ flux assays
Defolliculated stage V–VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were microinjected with 10 ng of cRNA
coding for the various CCCs, and maintained for 3 days at 18°C in Barth’s medium plus 125
μM furosemide. Oocytes were pre-incubated for 1h in a hypotonic solution (~55 mM Cl −
and 125 mOsm) for KCC1, KCC3 and KCC4, a low Cl−/hypertonic solution (~5 mM Cl−
and 285mOsm) for NKCC1 and NKCC2, and a physiological solution (86mM Cl− and
~200mOsm) for KCC2, containing either CLP257 or DMSO. Unlike KCC2 that functions in
isotonic conditions, KCC1, KCC3 and KCC4 require a cell swelling stimulus to be
activated. Oocytes were then incubated for another 45 min in a regular flux medium
containing either CLP257 or DMSO, bathed several times in a wash solution and lysed in
pure nitric acid16. Rb+ content was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry (Varian
AA240). All steps were carried out at room temperature. Results are expressed as percent
change of Rb+ influx in compound-treated oocytes versus Rb+ influx in vehicle-treated
oocytes.
Imaging of Cl− transport in rat spinal neurons
Parasagittal spinal slices (400 μm-thick) were kept alive prior to imaging during ~5.5 h in
bubbled ACSF at 34 °C. For PNI rats, imaging was performed on slices ipsilateral to the
nerve injury. For naïve rats, after 1 h recovery, slices were treated for 2 h with 50 ng ml−1
BDNF and for an additional 2 h with BDNF and DMSO or different CLP257 concentrations.
Slices were then incubated in ACSF containing 5 mM of the Cl− indicator MQAE (N-6-
methoxyquinolinium acetoethylester, Molecular Probes) for 30–40 min and transferred to a
perfusion chamber (2 ml min−1). Extracellular MQAE was washed out for 10 min in the
presence of 1 μM tetrodotoxin, 10 μM CNQX, 40 μM AP5, 1 μM strychnine and 10 μM
gabazine to minimize KCC2-independent Cl− transport. Fluorescence lifetime imaging of
MQAE was conducted as previously described9,10. Instrument response function of the
detection path was acquired using an 80-nm gold nanoparticle suspension to generate
second-harmonic signal. Recorded cells were visually identified by merging transmitted
light and MQAE fluorescence. Lifetime images were acquired every 10 s for a period of 7
min. After a control period of 50 s, perfusion solution was switched to ACSF containing 15
mM KCl (osmolarity adjusted using mannitol) to reverse KCC2-mediated Cl− transport40.
Lifetime in each cell was averaged over the whole cell body area and extracted for each time
point using custom-made Matlab software. Lifetime changes for each slice were then
expressed as the mean of changes occurring in each cell. Briefly, based on the work of
Digman et al.41, we converted the photon timing histograms of each acquired lifetime image
to phasor plots. Then, for every time-point, regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to cell
bodies were selected and added to a new phasor. Lifetime of all the cells was averaged for
each slice at each time-point to generate the lifetime time-course.

Electrophysiological recordings in rat spinal neurons
Whole cell clamp recordings were performed in parasagittal slices of lumbar spinal cord
from rats as described previously9,42,43. For experiments involving PNI rats, all recordings
were made from slices ipsilateral to the nerve injury. In BDNF experiments parasagittal
spinal cord slices were incubated in BDNF (50 ng/ml) for > 1 h prior to experimentation.
For whole-cell experiments involving measurements of E under Cl− load, borosilicate
GABA
patch pipettes had a resistance of 4 to 5 MΩ when filled with a potassium methylsulfate-
based intrapipette solution9,43. Data were filtered during acquisition with a low pass filter set
at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz using pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices). Data analysis was
performed off-line with Clampfit 10.2 (Molecular Devices). All recordings were performed
at physiological temperature (30–34 °C) in standard ACSF9,42 supplemented with 10 mM 6-
cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), 40 mM D(−)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric
acid (AP5), and 1 mM TTX. In experiments with BDNF-treated slices, the ACSF was
supplemented with 50 ng ml−1 BDNF. To study the effects of CLP257 on GABA receptor
A
function, a CsCl-based intrapipette solution42,44 was used and the ACSF was supplemented
with the KCC2 inhibitor VU0240551 (10 μM; Tocris Cookson, Ellisville, MO). GABA (1
mM) was puffed approximately 10 μm from the center of the soma for 30 ms. Only neurons
with stable access resistance were included for subsequent analysis. Experimental E
GABA
was extrapolated from the GABA I–V relationships.

Nerve injury models and behavioural testing
Under isoflurane anesthesia (induction at 4%, maintenance at 2%) a polyethylene cuff
(PNI)20,28 or loose chromic gut ligatures (CCI)29 were implanted around the left sciatic
nerve of 190–200 g male Sprague-Dawley rats. Mechanical allodynia was quantified by
assessing the paw withdrawal threshold using von Frey filaments (Stoelting, USA) using the
up and down method45. Animals were classified as allodynic when their paw withdrawal
thresholds were below 2 g (PNI) or 5 g (CCI) for at least two consecutive days after a
constant decrease for > 10 days post-surgery. Allodynia was measured prior to dosing
(baseline) on the test day, and then animals received an intraperitoneal dose of vehicle (20%
2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin), CLP257 or Gabapentin, or an oral dose of vehicle,
CLP290 or Pregabalin. Pregabalin was preferred to Gabapentin for comparison with
CLP290 because it has more predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics than
Gabapentin when given orally.
Evoked field electrophysiological recordings in the superficial dorsal horn
Laminectomies were performed in control and PNI rats (350–450 g) to expose the L4-S1
segments of the spinal cord under isoflurane anaesthesia (induction at 4%, maintenance at
2%). To reduce breathing artefacts the animals were paralyzed with pancuronium bromide
(Sigma, USA) and ventilated artificially (SAR-830, CWE, USA). Expired CO2 and body
temperature was maintained at 4%. and 37 °C. The rat was placed in a stereotaxic and spinal
frame with two clamps fixed on its vertebra to immobilize the spinal cord. A spinal
perfusion chamber, continuously perfused with sterile heated (35°C) buffered saline (10 mM
HEPES, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), was created by cutting a window in a solidified 4% agar
bloc. For drug applications CLP257 was diluted in buffered saline from a DMSO stock

solution to a final concentration of 100 μM (0.1% DMSO) and perfused for 30 min before
subsequent measurements were performed to ensure that stable concentrations were reached
within the tissue. 4 μM TTX (Sigma/RBI) was used as a control to abolish field responses. A
locally designed, automatically controlled, force-feedback mechanical stimulator was used
to apply graded and stable mechanical stimulations on the glabrous skin of the paw. Eight or
nine graded step pressures covering a large range from non-noxious to noxious stimulation
(5–140 g (mm2)−1) were used with a 2 mm2 tip. A 2–4 min recovery period was allowed
between stimuli to minimize sensitization.. In vivo field recording using a glass electrode
(1–3 MΩ) were obtained from the superficial section of the dorsal horn (300 μm) that
receives input from the glabrous skin of the hind paw. A glass electrode (1–3 MΩ) was
mounted on a motorized micromanipulator (Burleigh 6000, USA). The signal was amplified
(ER-1 Cygnus Technology, USA), filtered at 0.002–2 KHz, digitized at 20 KHz with a
Power1401mkII (CED, UK) and analysed with Spike2 (CED, UK). To evaluate the effect of
the mechanical stimulations, we analysed the area under the curve of the field response
generated by the different stimuli. Field area was normalized to the maximal control
response for each cell and averaged.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
CLP257 and CLP290 (in 20% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin) were administered IV, IP or
PO to adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Blood samples were collected from the saphenous
vein pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 7 h post-dose. Each blood sample (approximately 0.5
ml) was collected into a tube containing an anticoagulant (Na -EDTA). Samples were kept
2
on ice until centrifuged. The plasma obtained from each sample was recovered and stored
frozen (at −80°C) pending analysis by LC/MS.
Rotorod assay
Baseline motor performance was measured on the day of the test, prior to administration of
test compounds, using an accelerating rotorod (IITC). Time on rod was assayed twice for
each animal. CLP290 (in 20% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin), Pregabalin (in 0.9% NaCl)
or vehicle (20% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin) were then administered orally. Rotorod
performance was measured again 2 h post-dose. Results are expressed as percent of pre-dose
time on rod for each group of animals.
Competitive binding assays
The competitive binding inhibition of 10 μM CLP257 for a number of receptor systems was
assessed using validated radioligand competition binding assays under conditions defined by
the contractor. Additional information on the assay conditions can be obtained from the
contractor’s website (www.cerep.fr).
GABA receptor automated whole cell patch-clamp

Toxicological studies
CLP290 (200, 600 and 2000 mg kg−1 day−1) and vehicle (20% Captisol) control were
administered twice daily by gavage to Sprague-Dawley rats (5 males and 5 females per dose
level) for 7 consecutive days. Mortality checks, clinical signs, food consumption and body
weights were observed during treatment. At the end of treatment animals were food-
deprived overnight and urine was collected for urinalysis. Terminal blood was collected from
the abdominal aorta for clinical pathology evaluations followed by necropsy. Blood collected
in EDTA-containing tubes was evaluated for complete blood count. Blood collected in
citrate-containing tubes was analyzed for activated partial thromboplastin time, and
prothrombin time. Blood collected in tubes containing clotting-activator gel was analyzed
for comprehensive metabolic panel, A/G ratio (calculated), cholesterol (total), globulin
(calculated), phosphorus (inorganic), triglycerides. Urine was analyzed for bilirubin, blood,
color and appearance, glucose, ketones, microscopic analysis, pH, protein, specific gravity,
urobilinogen, volume. Adrenals, brain, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, ovaries, pituitary,
prostate, spleen, testes, thymus, thyroid with parathyroids, and uterus were trimmed free of
fat and weighed. Paired organs were weighed together and organ weight was normalized to
terminal body weight. Brain, heart, kidneys, and liver were embedded in paraffin, sectioned
and stained. All in vivo toxicological studies were performed blindly by an independent
contract research organization.
hERG inhibition of tail current—The inhibitory effect of CLP257and CLP290 on hERG
channel tail current amplitude was assessed using validated automated patch-clamp assays
under conditions defined by the contractor. Additional information on the assay conditions
can be obtained from the contractor’s website (www.cerep.fr).
Cytotoxicity—rat hepatoma derived H4IIE cells were cultured in Eagles Minimum
Essential Medium with 10% bovine serum and 10% calf serum (Invitrogen). Flat bottom 96-
well plates were seeded with 10,000 cells per well 48 hr prior to dosing. On the third day
CLP257 (in 0.5% DMSO; 300 μM CLP257 in 1.5% DMSO) was added to the plates.
Caspase-3 activity was determined using a caspase substrate (DEVD) labeled with cleavable
7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC). Following CLP257 exposure, medium was aspirated
and PBS added to each well. Plates were stored at −80°C to lyse cells before analysis.
Caspase buffer with fluorescent substrate was added to each well and incubated at room
temperature for 1 hr. AMC release was measured in a spectrofluorometer (excitation: 360
nm, emission: 460 nm).
Statistics
All data are given as the mean ± SEM unless otherwise started. As data distribution
normality (Gaussian) was not assumed, non-parametric tests were used excepted where
indicated. Differences between groups were tested by Mann-Whitney test or by Kruskal-
Wallis test with post hoc Mann-Whitney or Dunn tests. Paired comparisons were analyzed
by Wilcoxon signed ranked test. Repeated measures were analyzed by ANOVA or
Friedmann test with post hoc Dunnet test or Wilcoxon test. Exponential fittings were
compared by F test. Sample sizes are consistent with those reported in similar studies.
Differences were considered to be significant at P < 0.05.
