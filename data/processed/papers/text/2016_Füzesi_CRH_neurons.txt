Hypothalamic CRH neurons orchestrate complex
behaviours after stress

Allorganismspossessinnatebehaviouralandphysiologicalprogrammesthatensuresurvival.
Inordertohavemaximumadaptivebenefit,theseprogrammesmustbesufficientlyflexibleto
account for changes in the environment. Here we show that hypothalamic CRH neurons
orchestrate an environmentally flexible repertoire of behaviours that emerge after acute
stress in mice. Optical silencing of CRH neurons disrupts the organization of individual
behavioursafteracutestress.Thesebehaviouralpatternsshiftaccordingtotheenvironment
afterstress,butthisenvironmentalsensitivityisbluntedbyactivationofPVNCRHneurons.
These findings provide evidence that PVN CRH cells are part of a previously unexplored
circuit that matches precise behavioural patterns to environmental context following stress.
Overactivity in this network in the absence of stress may contribute to environmental
ambivalence, resulting in context-inappropriate behavioural strategies.

ethogram we describe is a broader representation of
microstructure of individual behaviours that has recently been
demonstrated38. These authors conclude that the individual
elements of a given behaviour represent a library of physical
motifs that can be re-purposed and re-sequenced to generate
distinct behaviours. As we did not observe any ‘new’ behaviours
after stress, we would put forward a similar analogy here
suggesting that individual behavioural traits are indeed re-
purposed into more complex behavioural programmes. Our
