Abstract
General anestheticsproduce aconstellation of behavioral responses andwidespread neurodepression. Recentstudies haveimplicatedthe γ-
aminobutyric acid (GABA) subtype A receptor as aprimary anesthetic target. Duringthe past decade,considerable progress has beenmadein
dissecting the behavioral effects of anesthetics according to the subunit composition of GABA receptors. In this review, we describe how

2. Anesthetics and GABA receptor physiology
A
GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the
mammalian brain, and as many as one-third of all synapses
are GABAergic(Bloom and Iversen, 1971). Most inhibition is
mediated by GABA receptors, which are chloride-permeable
